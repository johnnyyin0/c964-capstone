# C964 Capstone Project - Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project is part of my capstone for the Western Governors University (WGU) C964 course. It involves developing a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on historical real estate data. The goal is to create a predictive model that can assist users, such as homebuyers or real estate agents, in estimating property prices in a specific location based on input features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, property size, and more.
